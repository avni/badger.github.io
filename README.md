# Badge Press

If you have a GitHub Universe badge, this little SPA web app will help you customize it from the comfort of your own web browser.  As long as that web browser supports the Web Serial API's (i.e. Chrome or Edge)

[Badge Press](https://badger.github.io/qrcreator/)

First of all, type your GitHub handle.  A background process will then try to guess the rest of the fields based on the data in your profile but you can easily override them.

Plug in the badge to your desktop machine - ideally directly and not via a USB Hub.

Next up, press "Copy to badge".

You then need to select the serial device to connect to. If you are not sure, unplug the badge and see which one dissapeared and then plug it back in again and select it

When the files have been uploaded, the badge will reset.
